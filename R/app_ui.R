Learning Excel and macros, I improved our forecasting worksheets. My next position as a highway safety analyst I stepped up my programming game. I took a graduate-level programming course and sparked a passion for R.

I'm always striving to increase my skill set and I hope to make maps more visually appealing while showing concise information.

          Fast forward a few years
I like to look for ways to streamline manual tasks, make dashboards, and to translate our data to a user-friendly visual for the general public. I use R notebooks to do my analysis and data viz. I also have a background in GIS.

I spend my free time as a strategy board game enthusiast, a cyclist, a kitchen experimenter, a bike tourer, a coffee roaster, and a solo traveler. I'm always on the lookout for a good pour-over coffee."
